This repo about simulating vintage VFO for tube transmitters. I plan to include support for receivers VFOs as well.
Spec:
* Tunable frequency in assumption of multiplication in tube trx
* Variable speed tuning (faster rotation larger steps)
* Frequency and band displayed on OLED display
* Straight key support for VFO manipulation
